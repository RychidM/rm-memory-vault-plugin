# Skills Reference

One reference card per skill. Each card is a quick lookup — purpose,
command and arguments, trigger phrases, which files it reads and writes,
the rules that matter, and related skills.

The authoritative behavior for each skill lives in its
`skills/{id}/SKILL.md`. These cards summarise; the SKILL.md governs.

## Shared conventions

Several behaviors are common to every skill:

- **Vault-root resolution** — `$AGENT_MEMORY_VAULT` → Filesystem MCP
  allowed dir → `~/obsidian-memory-vault`.
- **Status semantics** — `[PENDING]` / `[APPROVED]` / `[PROMOTED]` /
  `[DISCARDED]` / `[DEFER]` on log entries.
- **Schema-preserving marker-flip** — status changes anchor on the
  `summary:` + `status:` two-line pattern, one flip per edit.
- **One-level nesting** — projects nest at most one deep
  (`projects/{parent}/{module}/`).
- **Never delete** — write skills append, transform in place, or
  relocate; they never destroy content.

Read-only skills (`vault-status`, `vault-find`, `vault-read`) never write.
